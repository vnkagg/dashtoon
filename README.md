(*) The App is Responsive for Desktop and Mobile Screens only, Tablet Layouts have not been incorporated as of now.

(*) On mobile devices, do not switch between portrait and landscape modes once the page has been landed. Render the page directly in the desired mode, i.e Either keep the phone in landscape mode before and after loading the page or keep the phone in portrait mode before and after loading the page

(*) The web app was designed in the form of a wizard for generating AI responses, and thus an option to proceed or go back is provided only at the steps when it makes sense. i.e you cant go to the landscape once you get started. but you can go back to re-enter the prompts once you have generated some AI responses from your existing prompts.

(*) The app builds a 10-panel comic strip. That is, you need to enter 10 separate prompts corresponding to each an AI visualisation will be built. If you try to generate a response by entering less than 10 prompts, the app will redirect you to the prompt index you skipped.

(*) The option to generate the responses will be available only when you are visiting the 10th prompt dialogue. 

(*) The response time for one API call can be on average 20-30 seconds. For 10 prompts, you can expect an ETA for 2-3 minutes.

(*) You should treat the desktop app like a mobile screen to navigate between the comic strip generated on the desktop app. i.e. you should click somewhere, preferrably above or below the comic strip (avoiding on the comic strip, as it can sometimes lead to drag events and less smooth behaviour) and drag the cursor to the direction you want to scroll the strip.

[BONUS] 
(*) There is an option to add text boxes on the comic strip on both the mobile and desktop apps.
    [Desktop] • The desktop version gives a more comic strip feel as it will behave like a one continuous strip with text boxes on it.
              • On clicking at any position (on the image), a text box will appear (extending towards the right) where you can immediately start typing.
              • Clicking a Text Box with content will delete the text box
    [Mobile]  • On mobile, you have to index using prev and next buttons provided to iterate between the comic pages. 
              • You can simply click on the position    where you want to add a text bubble and a box will appear.
